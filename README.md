# 🧠 Sales Insights Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

This project visualizes ₹985M revenue & 2M sales quantity from a multi-city retail dataset. Built with Power BI, SQL, and DAX.

### 🔍 What I tackled:
Tracking performance is easy. Finding what's hurting growth is hard.
So I built a dashboard that does both — in one view.

### 🛠️ What I built:

-Auto-updating Power BI dashboard with DAX-driven KPIs
-Revenue trends, YOY comparisons, and drilldowns by region, customer & product
-Highlighted low-performing zones (e.g., Bengaluru: -20.8%) and surfaced top customers (₹413M+)
-Integrated profit margin sliders and calendar filters for real-time business queries

📈 Result:
A single dashboard that helps any stakeholder answer:
🧠 “Where are we losing profit?”
🧠 “Which cities/products need attention?”
🧠 “What’s changing quarter-to-quarter?
## 🔍 Features:
- Revenue, Profit Margin, and Sales Trend dashboards
- Market-wise contribution, YOY trend, and negative-profit detection
- DAX Measures: `Revenue LY`, `Profit Margin %`, `Sales Qty`, etc.
- Dynamic filters by year/month, customer, product
- Identifies anomalies (e.g., -20.8% drop in Bengaluru)

## 📊 Tools Used:
Power BI, DAX, SQL Server, Power Query, Visual Analytics
